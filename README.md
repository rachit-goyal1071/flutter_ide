## Architecture

### File System Abstraction

The app uses a platform-aware file service pattern:

- `FileService` (interface) - Defines operations: `pickDirectory`, `readFile`, `createFile`, `createDirectory`, `saveFile`, `deleteFile`, `deleteDirectory`, `rename`
- `FileServiceIO` - Implementation for native platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android)
- `FileServiceWeb` - Implementation for web browsers using File System Access API

### Global Terminal API

Run terminal commands from anywhere in the app:

```dart
import 'editor_screen.dart';

// Execute any command
runTerminalCommand('flutter run');
runTerminalCommand('flutter pub get');
runTerminalCommand('dart analyze');
```

### Data Models

- `FileNode` - Abstract base class for file system entities
- `FileNodeDirectory` - Represents a folder with children
- `FileNodeFile` - Represents a file with optional cached content
- `WebTab` - Represents a WebView tab with title and URL
